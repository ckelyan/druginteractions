If not, use an alternative.  If the patient is at risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, start a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment. The risk factors to have gastrointestinal bleeding are the following: > 65 years, high dose of AINS ( more than 2 times the usual dosage), history of uncomplicated gastrointestinal ulcers, concomitant use of aspirin (even at low dose), corticosteroids or oral anticoagulants. Assess the appropriateness of introducing a PPI if only 1 to 2 risk factors are present. Directly introduce a PPI if 3 or more risk factors are present.\nException 1: Caution and increased monitoring for bleeding signs in case of co-administration of an anticoagulant with carbasalate calcique. \nException 2: Concomitant use of Aspirin with oral anticoagulant is not recommended: assess the indication to continue both treatments.",
